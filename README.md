ember-cli-deploy-s3-pack

> An ember-cli-deploy plugin pack to implement a simple S3 deployment pattern

![](https://ember-cli-deploy.github.io/ember-cli-deploy-version-badges/plugins/ember-cli-deploy-s3-pack.svg)

This package bundles the plugins you need to have a deployment pipeline for your Ember app to S3. It is based on the [AWS](https://github.com/kpfefferle/ember-cli-deploy-aws-pack) pack, but does not assume you are using Cloudfront.

It also has a blueprint for your `config/deploy.js` file to get you started.

## Installation

```
ember install ember-cli-deploy
ember install ember-cli-deploy-s3-pack
```

The necessary set of plugins will be available to ember-cli-deploy and an example `deploy/config.js` file will be generated for you to customize with information for your deployment environments.

## What is a plugin pack?

A "plugin pack" is a concept supported by ember-cli-deploy that allows a single addon to make multiple plugins available by adding a single direct depedency to your project.
